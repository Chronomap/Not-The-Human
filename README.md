## Features
- One-piece case designed for 3D printing
  - designed for use with M2 heatset inserts.
- Can be run plateless, and that's the only thing I've tested
- 0Â° typing angle 
- Even chamfer all the way around with thick-ish bezels
- Cutouts for PrimeKB Bumpons (19x7.5x1.6mm)
- Bottom design to clarify
- Open source permissive license ([CERN-OHL-P](https://cern-ohl.web.cern.ch/home))

## Want one?

STL file for printing is available

Additional parts needed:
- Bruce the Keyboard PCB (Currently closed source)
- 4 M2x3(ish)mm heatset inserts for plastic
- 4 M2x4(ish)mm screws
- 4 [PrimeKB bumpons](https://www.primekb.com/products/bumpons)

## QA Notes
- I built this and it's fine, my unit was SLS printed from JLCPCB. It hasn't been tested with FDM printing

TL;DR: Files are provided as is and I accept no liability if they aren't good

## Etc.
Use what's in this repository as you see fit, within reason. 

If you build one, shoot me some pics! I'm best contacted on Discord @Chronomap
